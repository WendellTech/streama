Since this project is still quite new, system requirements are currently not well established. 

We have observed that systems with less than **2GB RAM** fail to start the Streama server when using the inbuilt database, using MySQL may be better for low end systems.

There have been reports of running Strema on a Raspberry Pi 3 with MySQL.
