* Best IDE is definitely IntelliJ IDEA, but eclipse also works
* get a local mysql running
* get grails 3.1.14 (Use [SDKMAN](http://sdkman.io/index.html) to download it)
* get JDK8
* open project in IDE and configure it to use grails 3.1.14 and your JDK
* run using run-app (or in IntelliJ, run with the play-button in the top)

Heres a video of me setting it up:
